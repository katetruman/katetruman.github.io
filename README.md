# About Kate

I am in my final year of study towards a PhD in Data Science at the
[School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/study/academic-study/engineering/schools-and-departments-engineering-forestry-product-design/school-of-mathematics-and-statistics), University of Canterbury, New Zealand.

As part of the [BioAI lab](https://biods.org), my research projects focus on birth-death sampling models used to infer evolutionary histories.
